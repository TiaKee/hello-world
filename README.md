# hello-world
This would be where I put completed projects I am dabbling with, of all languages/formats, though not the 'assignments from the books' that I am keeping in other repositories (because those aren't really made from creativity or knowledge as much as they're made by following the instructions and watching how it works out, as is how I learn).

Hopefully I can have some cool stuff to offer one day.
